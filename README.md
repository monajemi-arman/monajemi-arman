# Hi, I'm Arman ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a developer with a unique journey â€” starting from early tinkering with code and Linux, moving through pharmacy, and circling back to my first love: **computers, open source, and building things that matter**.

## ðŸ’» What I Do
- **Full-Stack Development**: Currently working with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript** to build modern, performant applications.  
- **Systems & Networking**: Background in **Linux, assembly, and networking fundamentals (CCNA self-study)** â€” strong focus on security and low-level systems.  
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Created and maintain a **breast cancer detection suite** (deep learning in Python) in collaboration with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Itâ€™s in real use at **Imam Hospital, Mashhad**.  
- **High-Performance Computing**: Built **Sparkling**, an application to set up, manage, and use **CUDA Spark nodes** for AI model training.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Growing In
- **Next.js ecosystem** and full-stack best practices.  
- Expanding skills across **backend, frontend, and distributed systems**.
- **C# & cloud-native runtimes** through side projects.

## ðŸ§© Past Highlights
- Built projects in **Perl** and **assembly** during high school.  
- Interned at **Part Software Company** as a backend JS developer.  
- Lifelong passion for **Linux, FOSS, and cybersecurity**.

## ðŸ”­ What Excites Me
I love exploring how systems work from the ground up â€” from assembly to AI, from networking to user-facing apps. My drive is to **bridge low-level computing knowledge with high-level product development**, making tools that are both powerful and accessible.
